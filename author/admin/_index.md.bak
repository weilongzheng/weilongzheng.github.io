<font color='blue'>Looking for highly-motivated students and postdocs to join our team to work on understanding how the brain works! Feel free to email me if you are interested!</font>

Hi, I am currently a Tenured-Track Associate Professor in Department of Computer Science and Engineering, [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/PeopleDetail.aspx?id=444). My research interests cover the broad areas of affective brain-computer interfaces, computational neuroscience, machine learning, AI, clinical healthcare, and biomedical engineering. 

Prior to SJTU, I was a Postdoc Associate in [Department of Brain and Cognitive Science] (https://bcs.mit.edu/) at [Massachusetts Institute of Technology] (https://www.mit.edu/) (MIT) in 2020-2021. I worked with [Michael Halassa] (https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=1c06AyMAAAAJ#) and [Robert Yang] (http://guangyuyang.org/) on developing computational models for thalamocortical interactions in cognition. In 2018-2020, I was also a research fellow in Department of Neurology, [Massachusetts General Hospital](https://www.massgeneral.org/), [Harvard Medical School](https://hms.harvard.edu/), working with [M Brandon Westover](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=helCG6IAAAAJ&hl=en), MD, PhD. I obtained my PhD degree in the [Center for Brain-Like Computing and Machine Intelligence](http://bcmi.sjtu.edu.cn/), [Department of Computer Science](http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/) (2012-2018), China, supervised by [Bao-Liang Lu](http://bcmi.sjtu.edu.cn/~blu/).I obtained my Bachelor degree from Talented Student Program in Department of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, China, in 2012. From 06/2016 - 09/2016, I was a visiting researcher in [The Cichocki Laboratory for Advanced Brain Signal Processing](http://bsp.brain.riken.jp/), [Brain Science Institute](https://cbs.riken.jp/en/), [RIKEN](http://www.riken.jp/en/), Japan. 
From 09/2014 - 03/2015, I was a visiting researcher in [Intelligent Systems Group](http://www.sc.ehu.es/ccwbayes/index.html), Department of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence, University of the Basque Country, Spain.
